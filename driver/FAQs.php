                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>What are the benefits of driving for CABMAN?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">The biggest benefit of driving for CABMAN is that you will earn money quickly and easily on your own schedule! CABMAN has developed a strong customer base through a number of innovative marketing and incentive programs, which will provide you with many trips each day to earn cash. Our commission structure is highly favorable for drivers and our prices fair, providing you with income when and where you need it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>What services we render?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">We offer two major service categories, the CLASSIC and EXECUTIVE Rides. Traditionally all our cars are selected and approved for use ensuring that comfort and efficiency are top priority. While classic serves the needs of those who desire to get to their destination with reasonably lower budget by providing a balance of comfort and affordability, the EXECUTIVE service caters for those who need a bigger or luxurious car like SUV and other state of the art cars.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>What’s your Price Structure?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">CABMAN prices vary by service category and are calculated according to a base price per kilometer. Also, we charge price per minute waiting for the Rider to encourage customers to avoid delaying drivers when they arrive for pick-up. For now, price per minute waiting in traffic is not enforced, but with time we will. This is purely based on our prerogative and we are at liberty to commence this charge whenever we feel like doing so. However, owing to the inconveniences at night, Night rates apply from 22:00 to 6:00.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>What is the mode of Payment?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">We are currently using three modes of payments for flexibility reasons. Customers can pay either directly to the driver using cash, or through the App using their Card or paying using our Wallet system. In this case, they fund their wallet and pay for the service from their wallet using the App.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>What is the commission structure?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">CABMAN’s commission is charged on a flat rate basis. It is calculated as 15% of any fare paid for every ride that a driver is given.</p>

                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>What is the mode of Payment by Riders?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">We are currently using three modes of payments for flexibility reasons. Customers can pay either directly to the driver using cash, or through the App using their Card or paying using our Wallet system. In this case, they fund their wallet and pay for the service from their wallet using the App.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>How do Drivers pay the commission to Cabman?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">Drivers are required to put down a deposit in their wallet when they first sign up for CABMAN from where CABMAN’s commissions are deducted for cash payments received by the drivers. As the driver provides rides for cash, that deposit is used up. If a customer pays by Debit Card or with the Wallet system, then CABMAN automatically credits the Driver’s Wallet with their own entitlement. The Driver is at liberty to withdraw same to his or her Bank account excluding the deposit. It is important to note that if the deposit in the Wallet or wallet balance reaches zero, the app will stop working until another deposit is made.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>How many trips will I get per day working for Cabman?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">The number of daily trips varies by demand. It is a function of availability and your time disposition. Drivers are in control of their time and they decide when to be active. So it depends on the time you put in and the availability of Riders. However, CABMAN does its best to garner enough Riders to ensure profitability for drivers. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>What are the requirements from the Drivers?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">Drivers are required to have the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Smartphone and data connectivity</li>
                        <li>A valid Driver’s License</li>
                        <li>Valid Vehicle particulars for the vehicle they intend using</li>
                        <li>A Clearance Certificate from the State Intelligence Bureau.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>If the App isn’t functioning, what should I do?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">We do our best to ensure minimal downtime on our App by constantly upgrading the App in line with innovations and realities in the industry. However, if your App isn’t working you may need to may need to restart and check your internet functionality. But if the problem persists, then you might need to reinstall the App from the Playstore. Where all these are done and the problem persists, please call CABMAN directly for assistance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-title"><i><b>What happens if I cancel a request after accepting?</b></i></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">Cancelling Request after accepting is certainly not in the interest of the CABMAN, but occasional occurrence is understandable. However, CABMAN reserves the right to ban drivers who cancel frequently from using the application.</p>
