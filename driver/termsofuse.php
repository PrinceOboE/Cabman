While CABMAN cannot
                        guarantee the return of any lost item and assumes no liability, we will do our best to return the item to you. There is no charge for this service.

                    <h4 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200; font-size: 1rem!important;">CABMAN does not currently charge a fee for ride cancellation. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future.

                    <h4 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200; font-size: 1rem!important;">Just as CABMAN holds its drivers to the highest standards of service and safety, so we also expect our riders to behave within certain limits. All riders are prohibited from smoking, drinking, or using drugs during the course of
                        a ride, and are also prohibited from riding if they have consumed excessive amounts of alcohol. The transportation of firearms or other dangerous weapons is also not allowed. In addition, shouting, abusing or insulting the
                        driver, or other overly garrulous behavior is not allowed during the ride. In the event that any of these policies are broken, CABMAN drivers may immediately end the ride, and rider may be banned from using CABMANâ€™s services
                        in the future.
