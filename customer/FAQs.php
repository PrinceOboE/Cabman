                        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">One major benefit of using CABMAN is the premium we place on Safety and getting you safely to your destination not just quickly, but at a pocket-friendly price! It is part of our policy to ensure that our Drivers are thoroughly screened by our Safety Control Unit, this has helped us to eliminate a reasonable level of careless danger within our organization. Our large fleet of drivers as well as our highly functional and user-friendly Mobile App goes a long way in ensuring minimal waiting time after booking your ride. Also, our automated pricing system which is calculated automatically based on a base price, distance, traffic waiting time, and customer waiting time, we eliminate unnecessary and annoying haggling situation between drivers and riders as you are charged the right price for the trip as it is communicated to you at the end of the trip on the App.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Also, for every trip you make using CABMAN and paying with our internal wallet system, you have a discount which is credited to your Wallet automatically and useable at any time. Again, from time to time we do grant promo discounts as well as loyalty benefits for our ardent users.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One other interesting feature we offer is the availability of a Bill Paying option in our Mobile App. This gives you the comfort of Buying Airtime, Data, Paying Cable TV Subscription as well as Electricity Bills from anywhere at anytime.
                        </h5>
                            <br>
                        <h5 class="card-title"><i><b>What services we render?</b></i></h5>
                        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">We offer two major service categories, the CLASSIC and EXECUTIVE Rides. Traditionally all our cars are selected and approved for use ensuring that comfort and efficiency are top priority. While classic serves the needs of those who desire to get to their destination with reasonably lower budget by providing a balance of comfort and affordability, the EXECUTIVE service caters for those who need a bigger or luxurious car like SUV and other state of the art cars.
                        </h5>
                            <br>
                        <h5 class="card-title"><i><b>What’s your Price Structure?</b></i></h5>
                        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">CABMAN prices vary by service category and are calculated according to a base price per kilometer. Also, we charge price per minute waiting for the Rider to encourage customers to avoid delaying drivers when they arrive for pick-up. For now, price per minute waiting in traffic is not enforced, but with time we will. This is purely based on our prerogative and we are at liberty to commence this charge whenever we feel like doing so.
                        </h5>
                            <br>
                        <h5 class="card-title"><i><b>What is the mode of Payment?</b></i></h5>
                        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">We are currently using three modes of payments for flexibility reasons. Customers can pay either directly to the driver using cash, or through the App using their Card or paying using our Wallet system. In this case, they fund their wallet and pay for the service from their wallet using the App.
                        </h5>
                            <br>
                        <h5 class="card-title"><i><b>What’s the guarantee I am safe using CABMAN?</b></i></h5>
                        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">For us at CABMAN, our security and safety concerns cut across both our Riders and Drivers. This is because both are integral parts of our business. This is why in the interest of both parties, we ensure proper vetting of our Drivers and in most cases, request for recommendation letter from highly placed citizens or security agencies. On the other part, to guarantee the security of the Drivers, we do not accept Guest users. All users (Riders) must register properly with every relevant information as well as profile picture. Consequently, while we ensure that only the safest and most reliable drivers will give you rides, the Drivers on their part are assured that Riders are traceable with their relevant information they supplied on registration.
                        </h5>
                            <br>
                        <h5 class="card-title"><i><b>Can I place multiple rides from my account?</b></i></h5>
                        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">No, you are not allowed to book more than one ride on the App at every point in time. You will be able to book another ride once your previous ride is ended and closed.
                        </h5>
                            <br>
                        <h5 class="card-title"><i><b>Can I schedule a Ride in advance?</b></i></h5>
                        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">CABMAN does not allow that for now, but if we commence that service in the future, we will make it known.
                        </h5>
                            <br>
                        <h5 class="card-title"><i><b>Can I book a ride for other people from my Account?</b></i></h5>
                        <h5 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 200;">CABMAN allows you request rides for people who from different location from wherever you are. All you need do is use the beneficiary’s address as Pick-up location. However, it is important to state herein that you are responsible for the conduct of your beneficiary and as such you will be held liable for any misconduct.
